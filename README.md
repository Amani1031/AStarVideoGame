In this game, miners roams around idly chopping down trees and returning to their home every once in a while to drop off any chopped off trees. There are fairies that locate tree stumps and use their magic to regrow the stumps into trees.

If the player clicks on the screen, a time machine will appear which ejects three evil prehistoric worms. These worms attack fairies and miners. If the fairies win the fight, the evil prehistoric worms are turned into modern, kind worms. If the prehistoric worms win, the golden fairy is turned into an evil, red fairy. The fight between the prehistoric worms and golden fairies is done using a health variable which decreases with every hit.

If a prehistoric worm attacks a miner, the miner has no way to defend itself and turns into a zombie.

The remaining golden faries must attack the evil red fairies and turn them back to golden and destroy all the prehistoric worms to win the game.
